# Transforming Personal Researcher Notes into Archival Descriptions

# Short summary
This investigation looked at how human generated notes could be automatically processed into catalogue descriptions and catalogue tags to improve the searchability of the archive for future users. Natasha Kitcher worked with a team of volunteers to generate researcher notes and then relied on CustomGPT to automatically transform handwritten and typed notes into catalogue descriptions.

# Research questions
* Can researcher notes be used to enhance pre-existing catalogue descriptions? 
* Can these notes aid efforts to link collections?
* How could we address personal researcher bias in an automated description process?
* What sort of toolkit would the researcher like to record their notes in?
* What form of acknowledgement would an archival user need to understand how their catalogue description was created?
